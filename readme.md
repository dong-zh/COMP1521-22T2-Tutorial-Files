# COMP1521 22T2 Tutorial Files

Please cross reference the lecture notes as I may have added things here and there to show things working/not working.

If you see a mistake, please let me know with dongzhu.huang@unsw.edu.au.

The feedback form can be found [here](https://forms.office.com/r/TmLgMqQSWK) if you wish to give me anonymous feedback.

Each week might have its own `readme.md` with a short summary of that week's topic. Those `readme`s don't cover every examinable topic, so please revise the lectures as well.

# Sarcasm 2, Electric Boogaloo

Dohn is now a fully certified keyboard warrior, and he now writes essays in text files that he wishes to sarcasise.

Write a C program that reads in an entire file and writes the sarcasised output into another file. The program should take 2 command line arguments: the input filename and the output filename.

```bash
./sarcasise2 essay.txt sarcasised.txt
```

Create the output file if it doesn't exist, and overwrite it if it does. The program do basic error handling.
